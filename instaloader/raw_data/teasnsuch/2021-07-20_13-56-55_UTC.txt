Infuse your tea properly ðŸ˜‰

Are you are not getting enough flavor? 
If not, add more tea or reduce the amount of water.

Do you always have large amounts of loose leaves in your cup after removing the infuser?
You may need a larger infuser or one with smaller holes, both to catch the residue. 

If your tea bitter or lacks flavor?
You may need to shorten steeping times or reduce the heat of your water to avoid burning the leaves when steeping. OR simply add honey for sweetness.
